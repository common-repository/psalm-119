		Your statutes are my delight

		Do not let me stray from Your commands
		I have hidden Your word in my heart
		Preserve my life according to Your word
		My soul is weary with sorrow; strengthen me according to Your word
		Give me understanding, so that I may keep Your law
		Turn my eyes away from worthless things
		Preserve my life according to Your word
		May Your unfailing love come to me, Lord
		I will always obey Your law
		I will speak of Your statutes before kings
		Remember Your word to Your servant
		Your promise preserves my life
		You are my portion, Lord
		I have sought Your face with all my heart
		Be gracious to me according to Your promise
		I am a friend to all who fear You
		Teach me knowledge and good judgment
		You are good, and what You do is good
		Your hands made me and formed me
		May Your unfailing love be my comfort
		Let Your compassion come to me that I may live
		My soul faints with longing for Your salvation
		In Your unfailing love preserve my life
		Praise be to You, Lord; teach me Your decrees";
